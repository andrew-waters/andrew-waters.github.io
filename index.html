        <p class="lead">Hi there, I'm Andrew and I'm a proud father of three <s>tough</s> beautiful girls and a Platform Engineer at <a href="https://www.moltin.com" target="_blank"><strong>moltin</strong></a>.</p>
        <p class="lead">I work on several open source projects and many private ones. I only drink one cup of coffee a day, otherwise it puts me off my darts.</p>
        <p class="lead">I communicate in <kbd>gif</kbd> format more than I probably should and dance on tables when I'm drunk at tech conferences. I'm sure a psychiatrist would have much fun with me, many insights.</p>
        <p class="lead">I get imposter syndrome on a daily basis, it makes me work harder: but never hard enough. I'd love to have the time to develop my perfectionism.</p>
        <p class="lead">My online dating profile would be much better thought out. It wouldn't have pictures of me dancing on tables though. Maybe. Probably. OK, it would, but you won't find them here.</p>

        <p>I'm reserving this space to write about things. I have written things, many things on github, but I've been pretty bad at sharing my experiences outside of that domain. I do want to change that though. I read a lot of other peoples thoughts and would like to feed back. When I'm not being sarcastic on Facebook.</p>
