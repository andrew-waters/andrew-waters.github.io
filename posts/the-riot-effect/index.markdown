The recent riots across the UK propped up news websites with many tuning in online. No one wants to know about the Arts?

Looking at this image, taken from the Freedom dashboard today, can you figure out when the web stopped paying attention to their regular browsing habits?

We all know how much of a boost in traffic social networks get during these times, but has anyone ever researched the fallout on other sites? That would make an interesting read (well perhaps predictable, but I imagine the quantification will have some pretty large numbers attached to it)
